                    Although we have been in the business of yeeting since 1337 AC as it was then we invented the infamous "eternal yeet" which discovered the secret to eternal human life, our official company was not founded until 1821 when fredom was invented by the americans and we could monopolize the yeet market however we wanted. Through many controveries, delibarate wars, much colonisation and a lot of fun we have arrived to today. Today we strive towards delivering the best quality yeets and at the cheapest price. Crushing all other competitions within the yeet market has been a breeze and through a number of non-forced company buyouts we have finally assured that customers can only buy yeets from the superior supplier.
